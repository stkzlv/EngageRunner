# Bump Version Playbook

Read project versioning guidelines and determine if version bump is needed.

## Process
1. Read `VERSIONING.md` for versioning rules.
2. Review all branch changes: `git log main..HEAD --oneline`.
3. Determine version bump type based on changes.
4. Update version in all locations.
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Version Locations
- `pyproject.toml` - main project version

## Semantic Versioning (X.Y.Z)
- **Major (X)**: Breaking API changes.
- **Minor (Y)**: New features (backward compatible).
- **Patch (Z)**: Bug fixes only.

## Changelog Format (Keep a Changelog)
```markdown
## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

### Removed

```

## Rules
- Only bump ONE version number per release (highest priority wins).
- Never modify released version contents.
- Document breaking changes clearly.
- Use conventional commit messages to determine bump type:
  - `feat:` → Minor bump
  - `fix:` → Patch bump
  - `BREAKING CHANGE:` or `!` → Major bump
